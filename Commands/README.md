## Commands
This folder is where all the commands will be stored.

**Footnote:** As of now, there is only one file [Commands.cs](./Commands.cs), it's because there aren't a lot of commands right now. As more commands get created, this file will split into multiple ones and will be sorted and named (classes) by category.
